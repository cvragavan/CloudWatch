Step1: Install the awslogs package. This is the recommended method for installing awslogs on Amazon Linux instances.

# sudo yum install -y awslogs

Step2: Edit the /etc/awslogs/awslogs.conf file to configure the logs to track. For more information about editing this file, see CloudWatch Logs Agent Reference.

Step3: By default, the /etc/awslogs/awscli.conf points to the us-east-1 region. To push your logs to a different region, edit the awscli.conf file and specify that region.

Step4: Start the awslogs service.

# sudo service awslogs start

If you are running Amazon Linux 2, start the awslogs service with the following command.

# sudo systemctl start awslogsd

Step5: (Optional) Check the /var/log/awslogs.log file for errors logged when starting the service.

Step6: (Optional) Run the following command to start the awslogs service at each system boot.

# sudo chkconfig awslogs on

If you are running Amazon Linux 2, use the following command to start the service at each system boot.

# sudo systemctl enable awslogsd.service

Step7: You should see the newly created log group and log stream in the CloudWatch console after the agent has been running for a few moments.
